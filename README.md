# Description
## TL;DR: 
I build a tiny tool which solved the pain point of one person on Twitter.
A quick POC, it's a very simple UI that lets you drop in an address and picks up all message sent to it.


## Context:
When an hack happend on the crypto space, sometimes (most times) the hacker will send an onchain message via a transaction to the protocol contributors, those are available for everyone to see and to follow. Usually it is via etherscan which enable people to do so.
Another use case if for analyst to follow back and forth discusions via this canal.

### The tweet that started this POC:

### The POC page looks like the following at the moment:

Not a real problem worth working on past this moment so for now on will stay at the POC stage.
